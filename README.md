# Zedboard_AD9361_radar
We made ISAC radar using Zedboard and AD9361, by receiving the transmitted chirp signals, calculating the autocorrelation and FFT to get the ranging domain (delayed), and calculating the extracted 128 packets of data to do FFT to get the Doppler domain (slow FFT). This completes the distance and speed measurement.
